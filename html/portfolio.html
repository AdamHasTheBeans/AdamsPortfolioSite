                    It was recommended to me that I create a portfolio website to display my 
                    work. I wanted to create one but I also wanted to do something a little
                    different and a little special (to me at least). Rather than using a website
                    builder, I wanted to create my portfolio website from scratch. I made this
                    a goal of mine because I would consider the front end of web development
                    to be one of my weak points. So I took this as an opportunity to learn+improve
                    my web development skills, and as you might be able to see it's still
                    not a strong point of mine but I think that I have improved by leaps and bounds
                    compared to before.
                    <br><br>
                    one aspect I still want to improve on is making the website better on mobile
                    platforms since I have done little to no work on that.

                <p>
                    Intergalactic Post was a school project that I worked on with a team of 4.
                    It was for a software development class and in this project specifically, we
                    were putting a small form of Agile software development into practice (so
                    the focus wasn't necessarily the software but rather how we organized our
                    teams). We organized our actions via a Trello board and rotated team leaders
                    each week.<br> <br>
                    We decided to challenge ourselves by creating an entirely stock
                    HTML/CSS/javascript text-based adventure/idle game crossover based on a few
                    similar games that were already out there (cookie clicker is a good example).
                    This was an especially fun project for me since I had already taken a few
                    game programming classes to I took the lead when it came to developing
                    the background systems.

                <p>
                    In my last year of college I was able to take a class on advanced AI in
                    games. This was one of my favorite classes for multiple reasons but the
                    main reason was the flexibility of the projects. At this point,
                    we were already handed all of the tools needed to complete any assignment
                    the professor could throw at us. so the assignments we would get followed
                    a standard template where he would give us some form of high-level game AI
                    concept and have us implement it ourselves as well as create a blog post
                    explaining it. The blog posts were always interesting to write because we
                    were told to not just show off our code and instead show our understanding
                    by explaining it in words. I usually split the difference by pretending
                    that the reader had a decent level of understanding, but I think that this
                    practice ultimately made me better at explaining things to people like an
                    end-user.

                    In this post I talk about the benefits/drawbacks of using procedural

                    In this post I talk about the combination of obstacle avoidance and
                    flocking in games. to spice things up I also implemented it in 3D!.
                    this added an extra dimension of difficulty to the project but it looked
                    cool and set me apart from my classmate's projects that were still in 2D

                    In this post I use the bones from the last project and implement an

                    <br>
                    This was the last project I had in the class and we were given free
                    rein to choose a high-level game AI topic to research and develop.
                    I picked behavior trees (a game AI method that big AAA games use to
                    control AI characters in games) and used them to create a small Tank
                    fighting game. In the game, an enemy tank dynamically explores a map
                    trying to find the player in their own tank. Once the enemy tank finds
                    the player it will dynamically engage the player in a way that will
                    give it the most advantage
