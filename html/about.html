                    My name is Adam Currier and I am a Software/Game Developer from Vermont.<br>
                    Since I was a kid I've had a keen interest in exploring an eclectic array of
                    activities and pastimes that grab my interest. This usually leads to things
                    like me dabbling in various art mediums (paints, charcoal, digital, 3d),
                    trying out various activities such as learning piano, trying out odd
                    instruments, or playing disc golf (Vermont is great for disc golf)

                    I went to high school at Montpelier High School (MHS) where I was 
                    introduced to the magic of <span>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING</span>.
                    At the time the idea of computer programming was a pretty abstract 
                    concept that I only knew about from things like film and tv, but it ended
                    up becoming one of those things that I was interested in, so I decided
                    to explore it further via the Community Connections program at MHS.
                    This lead to me doing a brief stint in the VTRANS IT division
                    (as I'll explain later)

                    I decided to enroll at Champlain College, located in Burlington VT.
                    I chose Champlain for a couple of reasons. One of which was the game
                    development curriculum that I found to be quite fascinating
                    (I've had an interest in video games for most of my life). The
                    second reason was it's relatively close placement to home. It was close
                    enough that I could easily keep in contact with my family while also
                    being far enough away to give me a level of independence that I have never
                    experienced before.<br>
                    <br>
                    While at Champlain there was a brief moment where I was struggling to
                    envision myself in the future I was pursuing. What enabled me to overcome
                    this struggle was stepping back and reflecting on the work I had done up to
                    that point and re-defining where it could take me. Ultimately I think
                    it was overcoming this struggle that brought me to where I am today.
                    It helped me solidify my goals and gave me the strength to plow ahead
                    with some newfound pep in my step. I graduated from Champlain College
                    in May of 2021 with a degree in computer science, a specialization in
                    software engineering, and the goal of pursuing a career in software
                    development.

                    Despite how short the time I spent with the IT division in the
                    Agency of transportation was, it left a pretty big impact
                    on the future I would eventually pursue. It was my first time seeing a
                    real world application of what I would eventually end up going to college
                    for. I was able to see their team dynamic, the environment they worked in
                    as well as the range of services and technology that they had to cover.
                    It was also my experiences there that inspired me to apply to various
                    jobs for the Agency of Digital Services, overall it left a lasting impression
                    that this was a place that I could develop the skills I would need in 
                    software development (and that was comforting).

                    Nicom Coatings is a waterproofing company that I worked for over most
                    of my summer breaks while I was in college (as well as a few winter
                    breaks). My time at Nicom was important because it helped me
                    develop skills that I would need for practically any professional
                    work environment. It was also a job that rewarded having a solid work
                    ethic, so I did my best to develop myself as a valuable teammate. It was
                    also a career that was well outside of my wheelhouse, so it helped me develop
                    my learning skills. Almost Every jobsite would require me to develop the
                    skills necessary to complete the job as well as apply them dynamically.
                    This was crucial because all of the work we did would have a meaningful
                    impact on the buildings we worked on.
